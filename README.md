# Project Description


This project is a simple search engine that uses Algolia's search API to search for items in a dataset. The dataset is a JSON file that contains a list of recipes. The search engine allows users to search for recipes by name, ingredients, yield, cook time, or directions.


I also included some filters for the search results. Users can filter the search results by ranking (out of 5 stars) and serving size.


Selecting a recipe by clicking on the recipe name will display the recipe details in separate page.


# Intended Build:


Given the I chose to build a react app that would utilize the `react-instasearch` library. This made connecting to the Algolia API and building the search functionality very easy.


Given the time constraints, I chose to create a basic application that did not feature a lot of styling. I wanted to focus on the functionality of the search engine and the filters. As such, you will notice that the aesthetics of the application are very basic. If I were building this for a production environment, I would spend more time on the styling, testing, error handling, and making sure the code is as clean as possible.




# Feedback:


I have several bits of feedback for the Algolia SE team on this assignment:


- The instructions were very clear, thank you for that.
- This assignment seems to me to be very heavily engineering focused, which seems odd for a sales engineer position. When I have given these types of assessments to candidates in the past, I have focused on making sure the candidate demonstrate proficiency with the product, and also testing their ability to convey the value of the product to a prospect. While I understand that each company's requirements are different, I have not had the impression from the job description or in my interviews thus far that this role would require a lot of building from the ground up.
- In my creation of this project, I found that the Algolia documentation's architecture was difficult to navigate. I did not find a satisfactory "follow the bouncing ball" style implementation guide. While ultimately I was able to finish the project, I spent much more time navigating the documentation and trying to understand if the page I was on was relevant than seems necessary. I worry about what this means for prospects who are trying to use Algolia for the first time without guidance.
- The React documentation in particular is lacking. I was surprised that the most popular JS web framework was not better represented in the documentation.



All in all, I had a lot of fun with this project, and look forward to hearing your feedback.


Thank you,


Jonathan Mucha.
